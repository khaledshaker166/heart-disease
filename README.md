# Heart-Disease-Prediction-for-a classificationProblem
1. Your Guidance to build A Machine learning model to predict a heart disease.`
2. You will learn how to build a machine learning from scratch for a classification problem .
3. **I like begin with a promise to encourage you ! at the end of this notebook you will be able to build ML model and evaluate it by some metrics as the image you see below !!**
4. ![ML Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khaledshakerrr/heart-disease-Prediction/main/images/your%20achievement%20looklike.png)
5. we will navigate with each other in this notebook with our approach to build and choose the right ML for our problem
